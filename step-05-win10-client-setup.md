# Step 5 – Windows 10 Client VM Setup

As part of building the SOC lab, a Windows 10 client VM was installed on Proxmox to act as a test endpoint and domain-joined client. This VM will later connect to the Windows Server AD/DC for domain management and SOC monitoring.

## Next Steps

- Installed Windows 10 using VirtIO drivers (see [Error 4 – VirtIO Driver “No Signed Device Drivers” During Windows 10 Client Setup](error-4-virtio-driver-nosigned.md) for details).  
- Confirmed that VM successfully booted into Windows 10 after drivers were loaded.  
- Verified NIC and Balloon drivers installed inside the client VM.
